From this Booklet, You will grasp key shrimp farming secrets not available in our videos so you can have great crops and not waste feed (and your time).

We share practical tips for shrimp pond preparation, water quality and feeding management, including inorganic and organic fertilization (using microbial fermentation), what to do when water quality parameters get out of ideal range, and how much feed to give, both in the beginning (blind feeding) and later with assistance of feeding trays. 

Following the steps in this compact protocol will give you the support you need to have a healthy production for your shrimp.

**Disclaimer:** This is a straight-to-the-point 15-page manual. If you are after a comprehensive scientific book, or how to start an aquaculture business, this is not the book for you.

The booklet is updated and extended every year. New editions will be sent to supporters at no extra cost. 

100% of sales are donated to feed poor kids of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh and to support the activities of the [Street Surf School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=gFfZMNITKI0AP83m&v=ViUfvQQbVv8&feature=youtu.be).

For this reason, the booklet is not refundable.
